just what the most simply beautifuly understandable information to be told to the user 
---its takes times, to listen and work and understand the information being given via voice interface
---right but i dont want to hear all of that i can skip information i want to visually but not voice interface

#voice interfaces
i feel like the user should throw their entire question in and then have the computer tailor business needs according to said information 
and this can be manually done by the owner of the company you dont even need gpt 
unless your company already has a simple streamlined 2 click solution visually via you might not even need this but for complications like stripe.com, agencies even, or business that offer several solutions this might be it. 
--add a 'product gameplay' option  scenario for further clearization of the when the product will take place and how why its used" this will crystal clear and remove all ambibgousness and seconds guessing to the user
